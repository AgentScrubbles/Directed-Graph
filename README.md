Directed-Graph
This project was an assignment for my algorithms course. The idea is that an entire city is given to the program's main function as a text file of vertices (intersections) and edges (roadways).

The problem involves a list of requirements that must be retrieved in order. It builds a list of prerequisites around the city and sorts them in into a list. Using the list, a starting location, and a final location, it searches the entire city for the shortest path from the starting location, to each item in the list, and then to the final location.

This required implementing generic interfaces for the graph, Dijkstra's algorithm, topological sorting, and BFS/DFS searching.
